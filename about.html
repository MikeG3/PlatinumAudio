            <h2>From Childhood Curiosity to Professional Expertise</h2>
            <p>
                As a young child, Michael had a clock radio with an AM tuner that he quickly learned to tune to Montreal's local oldies station, 
                listening to music every night. Ever since that day, he was hooked. A little older, around the time CDs became the dominant music 
                format, Michael received his first 90s-style boombox. While it provided joy, it lacked the sound quality and visual appeal of his 
                father’s silver-faced receiver, with its mesmerizing power meters and the rumbling bass of acoustic research speakers. These speakers 
                filled their suburban home with the sounds of Beethoven, echoing through every room.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                As a teenager, Michael finally convinced his mother to let him play her flamenco guitar, a treasured instrument that had captivated 
                him since childhood. He began taking lessons at 16 and has continued to explore music ever since. By his twenties, with a modest 
                paycheck, he was able to invest in guitar gear and upgraded stereo systems. However, nothing could fully replicate the live music 
                experience or the sound of his favorite gear.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Finding a Passion in Vintage Audio</h2>
            <p>
                With the rise of Craigslist and eBay, Michael began exploring vintage audio equipment, discovering that gear from his father’s 
                era offered the best value and unmatched quality. Although these treasures often came with technical challenges, this coincided 
                perfectly with the start of his technical studies. By the time he acquired his first Marantz 2230 receiver, Michael had developed 
                enough skills to bring the equipment back to life, uncovering its unique and captivating sound.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Over the years, Michael completed a technical degree and an engineering degree, gaining experience in electronic manufacturing, 
                quality control, and repair. Working alongside an inspiring Swiss engineer, he honed his skills in meticulous electronic restoration 
                and manufacturing. His journey has included restoring dozens of vintage receivers from renowned brands like Marantz, Pioneer, Sansui, 
                McIntosh, and Kenwood, always seeking the perfect sound.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>A Professional Pursuit</h2>
            <p>
                Today, Platinum Audio stands as a testament to Michael’s lifelong passion and technical expertise. Whether restoring vintage 
                audio equipment, repairing modern systems, or creating custom solutions, Michael combines precision craftsmanship with a deep love
