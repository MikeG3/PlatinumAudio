              </li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>People Over Profits</strong>
                <p>My approach to business is simple: <strong>people over profits.</strong> Every piece of equipment I work on is treated with the utmost care and respect. I never rush through a job, and I’m not interested in cutting corners for the sake of speed or cost. My priority is providing you with the highest quality service, ensuring that your equipment performs better than ever—without compromise.</p>
              </li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>Meticulous Attention to Detail</strong>
                <p>I am <strong>meticulous</strong> about every aspect of my work. From <strong>restoring equipment</strong> to undoing damage done by previous technicians or DIY repairs, I ensure that <strong>no detail is overlooked</strong>. I believe that the smallest mistake can make a huge difference, and I take pride in doing things the right way—every time. Every repair, no matter how big or small, is done with precision.</p>
              </li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>Only the Best Parts</strong>
                <p>Your equipment deserves the <strong>best parts</strong>, and that’s exactly what I use.

              </li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>Thorough Testing and Re-Testing</strong>
                <p>I don’t just repair equipment—I <strong>test, double-check, and re-test</strong> everything to ensure flawless operation.

I’ll help your equipment perform like it’s brand new—ensuring that no matter how old or damaged it may be, it will <strong>continue to serve you for years to come</strong>.</p>
              </li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>Restoring Your Sound to Its Full Potential</strong>
                <p>I understand the frustration of <strong>sound cut-outs</strong>, <strong>imbalanced volume levels</strong>, <strong>noise</strong>, and <strong>distortion</strong> that plague even the most beautiful equipment. Don’t let your prized gear sit collecting dust because it’s not performing at its best. Let me restore it to <strong>its full potential</strong>, so you can enjoy clear, high-fidelity sound once again.</p>
