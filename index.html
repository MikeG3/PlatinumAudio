            <p>Platinum Audio was founded in 2014 by Michael Garner, a passionate engineer, musician and multi-disciplinary technician.</p>
            <br>
            <p id="story">From Childhood Curiosity to Professional Expertise
                <br><br>
                Platinum Audio was founded in 2014 by Michael Garner, a passionate engineer, musician, and multi-disciplinary technician with a lifelong love for sound and electronics. Michael’s journey into audio began with a simple clock radio as a child, tuning into Montreal's oldies station every night. That early fascination with music deepened as he explored the rich sounds of his father's vintage silver-faced receiver and powerful Acoustic Research speakers, which filled their home with the symphonies of Beethoven. These early experiences shaped Michael’s appreciation for both the artistry and engineering behind high-fidelity audio systems.
                <br>
                As a teenager, Michael’s passion expanded to music-making, convincing his mother to let him play her flamenco guitar and embarking on a lifelong journey as a guitarist. By his twenties, he began exploring guitar gear and upgrading his stereo equipment, only to find that modern systems often fell short of the warmth and presence of live music. It was this search for the perfect sound that led him to vintage audio gear, particularly receivers from Marantz, Pioneer, and Sansui. While these treasures offered exceptional sound quality, they often came with frustrating technical issues—issues that sparked his desire to learn the art of repair and restoration.
                <br>
                A Lifelong Passion for Audio and Engineering
                <br>
                Michael’s technical journey began with formal studies in electronics and engineering, complemented by hands-on experience in electronic manufacturing. Over eight years in the field, he worked his way from assembly and testing to quality control and assistant production supervisor, collaborating closely with an experienced Swiss engineer. This mentorship honed his meticulous attention to detail and deepened his expertise in electronics manufacturing and repair.
                <br>
                During the early resurgence of vinyl records, Michael began restoring and selling vintage audio equipment, amassing a collection of iconic pieces from brands like Marantz, McIntosh, and Kenwood. His work earned a reputation for quality and innovation, serving clients locally in Montreal, across Eastern Canada, and even internationally. Though his journey has taken him through rigorous engineering studies and demanding day jobs, his passion for audio restoration and the dream of creating his own equipment have remained steadfast.
                <br>
                Today, Michael blends his technical expertise with his artistic sensibilities to breathe new life into vintage audio systems, helping music lovers rediscover the warmth and character of classic sound. Through Platinum Audio, he continues to pursue his mission to restore, upgrade, and celebrate the artistry of audio equipment, sharing his love for music and engineering with clients worldwide.</p>
